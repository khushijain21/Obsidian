I am writing to formally announce my resignation from my position as Associate Engineer. 

This decision has not been easy, as I have greatly valued my time at CPRO and the opportunities I have had to grow both personally and professionally. I have learned a lot from my colleagues and have appreciated the support and guidance Iâ€™ve received during my tenure.

Please let me know how I can assist in ensuring a smooth transition during my remaining time here. I am committed to completing any outstanding tasks and helping to train my replacement if needed.

Thank you for the opportunity to be part of CPRO team. I wish the company continued success, and I hope our paths may cross again in the future.
