What was achieved:
- Added logic to convert swift metadata to OTel attributes, and map severity level to OTel's.
- Used logrecord builder to create a log record and emit it
- Checked build failures from pipeline and resolved it

What needs to be done:
- Write UT and resolve build conflicts.

Blocker:
- Was not able to virtualize macos environment for testing, continued development on wsl.
