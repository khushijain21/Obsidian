helm3 does not have ***backup*** command

where to access all the repo?

PowerShell includes four execution policies that apply to Windows 10:

-   **Restricted —** Prevents any script from running.
-   **RemoteSigned —** Allows scripts created on the computer, but scripts created on another device won't run unless they include a trusted publisher's signature.
-   **AllSigned —** All the scripts will run, but only if a trusted publisher has signed them.
-   **Unrestricted —** Runs any script without any restrictions.
