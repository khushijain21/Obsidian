Hello Team,

I found out about this mentorship on Linux Foundation [dot] org. I have been driven towards observability space for about a year now and have continued to make contributions to Grafana, Victoria Metrics and Beyla (ongoing work) as well. I have read much about open telemetry and its ongoing effort to provide support for all observability signals in various languages.  

I have the skills of working with Go-lang, Kubernetes and Helm. I can easily pick up new code and get started on it. I am currently a junior software engineer who is eager to learn about designing systems - so this will be a great opportunity to work in a familiar space with mentorship.

I wish to gain experience developing code and get deeper insights on how code instrumentation actually works.
