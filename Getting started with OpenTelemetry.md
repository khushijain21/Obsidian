This contains a list of starting resources that were helpful to me in understanding observability signals, distributed systems and opentelemetry. This page is actively maintained. 

Observability Signals
- This whitepaper by CNCF is a great (credible) resource to signals, signal correlation, SLI, SLO and more [CNCF Whitepaper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md#references)
- Problem Statement driven explanations (Practical guide to obs signals) - [New relic](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md#references )
Traces:
- What is distributed tracing by [Red hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/the-path-to-distributed-tracing-an-openshift-observability-adventure)
Logs: 
- OTel's approach for Log support -[OTel Log](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/)
- OpenTelemetry Logs by [signoz](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-logs/#what-are-opentelemetry-logs)

Putting it together
- OTel Collector Architecture by [Signoz](Observability Architecture and OTel Collector [Redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-build-opentelemetry-reaches-general-availability)
- You can run OTel Demo to see it all working together [Demo](https://aws.plainenglish.io/a-deep-dive-into-opentelemetry-running-the-opentelemetry-demo-7ec4fd436136)
- Best Practices for OTel Collector by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/12/18/opentelemetry-best-practices-a-users-guide-to-getting-started-with-opentelemetry/)
