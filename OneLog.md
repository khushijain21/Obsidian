how about a logger module with below features?

1. support structured and unstructured logging
2. support to add extensions(extra key/value pairs in json structure)
3. integrated with lumberjack (for log rotation)
4. support for users to create custom log levels Â apart from default ones (like TRACE, ALERT etc)
5. integration with syslog (can be standard or custom maintained with TLS support)
6. And all these things can configured using a config yaml (just like log4j.xml in case of java)
7. Support file logging


file:
	path: string
	logrotate: boolean

custom_log:
	name: string
	 level: string

extensions are supported
